# Introduction to Signal Processing GRCon21
Checkback for updates


## Abstract
This course serves as an introduction and survey of signal processing for beginner and intermediate levels. 
The course will introduce basic math concepts fundamental to Fourier and Laplace transforms. 
The course will explore properties of signals and systems including spectral estimation, detection and information theory. 
Furthermore, we will apply course concepts to analyze both continuous and discrete signals.
